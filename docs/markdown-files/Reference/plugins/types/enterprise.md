# The Enterprise plugins.

Scully has a category for Enterprise plugins. Unlike the other plugin catagories those plugins don't have a set interface, and do use a symbol for their name. This type of plugin can be used to add extra functionality to Scully.
For more information about enterprise plugins see our support page. If you want, you can add your own custom plugins into those slots.
Remember, there is no time that Scully will call any of those plugins. Those are there to add and compose your own additional plugins, while still using all the perks of the Scully plugin system.
